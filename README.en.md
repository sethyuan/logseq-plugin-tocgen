### Support generating TOC entries for embedded blocks/pages

![demo](demo_embed.gif)

The demo above used the plugin [Another Embed](https://github.com/sethyuan/logseq-plugin-another-embed), you're welcome to try it. The namespace collapsing behavior is part of my `custom.js`, you can find the code [here](https://gist.github.com/sethyuan/4ea9ed4305d0145ad565b2128ae6cef4).

## Examples

If you want to generate a TOC that dynamically changes according to what page you're currently working on, you can use `*` as page name. Recommended.

```
{{renderer :tocgen2, *}}

Specify a height for the TOC and its content will scroll in sync with the page content. CSS height units are accepted. `auto` means height is dependant on content.
{{renderer :tocgen2, *, auto}}
{{renderer :tocgen2, *, 300px}}
```

```
Generate a TOC for the page where block belongs to.
{{renderer :tocgen2}}
{{renderer :tocgen2, [[]]}}

Create a TOC for a page, you can use "[[" to help find the page.
{{renderer :tocgen2, pagename}}
{{renderer :tocgen2, [[pagename]]}}

You can also create a TOC for a block, just paste its reference in.
{{renderer :tocgen2, ((block-reference))}}

You can specify how many levels to generate.
{{renderer :tocgen2, [[]], auto, 2}}
{{renderer :tocgen2, [[pagename]], auto, 2}}
{{renderer :tocgen2, ((block-reference)), auto, 2}}

If you want to include only H1-Hn headings (h), that is, `#` to `######` in markdown,
or if you want any content be treated like a heading (any),
you need to use a third argument.
{{renderer :tocgen2, [[page name]], auto, 1, h}}
{{renderer :tocgen2, [[page name]], auto, 1, any}}
```

If there is a block that you don't want it to appear in TOC, you can give it a `toc:: no` block property.

## Style Customization

You can customize styles using the following CSS classes, `kef-tocgen-page` for page, `kef-tocgen-block` for block, `.kef-tocgen-active-block` for active block. Refer to Logseq's document for how to customize styles, place your modifications in `custom.css`.

```css
.kef-tocgen-page {
  cursor: pointer;
  line-height: 2;
}
.kef-tocgen-block {
  line-height: 1.7;
}
.kef-tocgen-active-block {
  font-size: 1.1em;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```

You can also use `kef-tocgen-noactivepage` to customize dynamic TOC's (see Examples section above) content and style when no active page is detected.

```css
.kef-tocgen-noactivepage::before {
  content: "üàöÔ∏è";
}
```
